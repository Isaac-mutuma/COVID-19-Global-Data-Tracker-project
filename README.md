# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

A data analysis project built using real-world COVID-19 data to visualize global trends in infections, deaths, and vaccinations.
This project compares how selected countries—Kenya, the United States, and India—responded to the pandemic over time.

---

## Project Objectives

- Import and clean COVID-19 data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-data)
- Analyze trends in total cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Compare metrics across countries
- Visualize key statistics and time series trends
- Communicate findings using charts and narrative summaries

---

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3**
- **pandas** – Data manipulation and cleaning
- **matplotlib** – Data visualization
- **seaborn** – Enhanced plotting
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis and reporting

---

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone or download the repository**
2. Place the `owid-covid-data.csv` file in the root or `data/` folder.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) in JupyterLab or VS Code.
4. Run all cells to load the data, clean it, and generate the visualizations.
5. Optionally, export the notebook as a PDF or HTML report.

## Key Insights

- **The United States** had an early surge in cases and led in vaccination rollout.
- **India** experienced delayed waves but reached high cumulative numbers quickly.
- **Kenya** had fewer reported cases and vaccinations, possibly due to testing/reporting capacity.
- Vaccination rollouts correlated with a visible slowdown in new cases for all countries.

## Reflections

This project demonstrates how publicly available data can be transformed into meaningful visual insights. 
It highlights the power of data storytelling using Python, and reinforces the importance of clean, well-documented code for communicating public health trends.
